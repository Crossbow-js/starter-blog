## Crossbow Blog Starter

A small example of how to run Crossbow as a static Blog
Engine. Checkout this [2 min screencast](http://quick.as/mvrsaqz) to see a preview
of what Crossbow gives you.

## Install 

- Clone / Download this repository
- `npm install`

## Usage

- First, run `npm start`

This will watch all files in the `src` directory
for changes and recompile when any change.
 
## Have fun

Have a play around and see what's there - we're in the process
of writing all the Docs for this, in the meantime have a sneak peak 
at what's possible by looking at some [tests](https://github.com/Crossbow-js/crossbow/tree/master/test/specs)
